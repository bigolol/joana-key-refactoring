This project is based heavily on the work of Marko Kleine BÃ¼ning: https://github.com/MarkoKB/Combined-Approach.
It aims at refactoring the code to make it more readable and extentable as well as creating a GUI to make user interaction with the system easier, less rigid and more custmizable.
The goal is to create a solution which combines System dependency Graph analysis (using joana) with symbolic program execution (using KeY) to analyize Information flow in programs.
